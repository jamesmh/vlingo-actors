  // This particular tuning is based on relatively few actors being spread
  // across 32 buckets with only 32 pre-allocated elements, for a total of
  // 1024 actors. This hard-coded configuration will have good performance
  // up to around 75% of 1024 actors, but very average if not poor performance
  // following that.
  //
  // TODO: Change to configuration-based values to enable the
  // application to estimate how many actors are likely to exist at
  // any one time. For example, there will be very few actors in some
  // "applications" such as vlingo/cluster, but then the application
  // running on the cluster itself may have many, many actors. These
  // run on a different stage, and thus should be tuned separately.
  // For example, preallocate 128 buckets that each have a Map of 16K
  // elements in initial capacity (and probably no greater than that).
  // This will support 2 million actors with an average of a few hundred
  // less than 16K actors in each bucket.
